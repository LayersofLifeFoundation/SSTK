I will be a ground item! Grab your wallets and pay to win with your acquired currency. I cost $1,000,000. Would you like some pride and accomplishment?

Don't mind the partial trees. Ryan designed the map like this. Thought it would be cool or something. Maybe he thought it would be some kind of creative twist on modern map making. He's done this in the past when he made the tile pixel size a nice odd number like 49 instead of the traditional 48. I'm fine with a map that doesn't look like a grid, but 2/3rds of a tree!?!. Anyway, I wonder if he'll look at the code and figure out how to send out counter-roasts. But I like my odds because he hasn't touched the code yet!

Don't talk to the evil man above me. He told me my game is boring and it tastes like a magnum dong. I was roasted so hard I died.

My proposal. W1: Swamp W2: Japan W3: DMI W4: FCC. First half is dank, second half is more ominous (But still full of memes)

Prepare yourself! Beyond here lies the most scary place imaginable, Japan! (maybe). Either that or dead meme island, the place memes go when they are influenced by ajit pai's corruption.
