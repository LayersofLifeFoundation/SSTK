Don't mind the partial trees. Ryan designed the map like this. Thought it would be cool or something. Maybe he thought it would be some kind of creative twist on modern map making. He's done this in the past when he made the tile pixel size a nice odd number like 49 instead of the traditional 48. I'm fine with a map that doesn't look like a grid, but 2/3rds of a tree!?!. Anyway, I wonder if he'll look at the code and figure out how to send out counter-roasts. But I like my odds because he hasn't touched the code yet!
